# Excel-Charts-Dashboards

This was a short project used to demonstrate proficiency in creating charts, dashboards and pivot tables in Excel
The data worked on was a spreadsheet of sales data from an imaginary company 

**Process**

- Created a pivot table
- Created and formatted a line chart to represent sales profits by month
- Created and formatted a bar chart to represent sales profits by sales person
- Created and formatted Pie charts to represent sales percentages by product category and city
- Created a dashboard containing charts and tables


## Pivot Table
- Made sure all columns were of the correct format and trimmed all columns of unnecessary spaces
- Sheet was converted into a table for easier analysis after data was cleaned and validated
- Created a pivot table  to find the total sales for each month
  - the month column was created by using the text function on the orderdate column to extract the month in the format "mmm" (For example, 01 = Jan)
  
  
## Line Chart
 
 The line chart was created to visualize the summary of Total sales for each month from the pivot table 

## Bar Chart
 
 The Bar chart was created to visualize the summary of Total sales by Salesperson based off a new pivot table created

## Pie Chart

 2 Pie charts were created to show the percentage of sales by city and the percentage of sales by category
 
## Dashboard
 The dashboard was created to show all the summarized data on one screen to show the overview of the data
