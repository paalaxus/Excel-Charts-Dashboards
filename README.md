# Excel-Charts-Dashboards

This was a short project used to demonstrate proficiency in creating charts, dashboards and pivot tables in Excel
The data worked on was a spreadsheet of sales data from an imaginary company 

**Process**

- Made sure all columns were of the correct format and trimmed all columns of unnecessary spaces
- Sheet was converted into a table for easier analysis after data was cleaned and validated
- Created a pivot table  to find the total sales for each month
  - the month column was created by using the text function on the orderdate column to extract the month in the format "mmm" (For example, 01 = Jan)
